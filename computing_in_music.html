            <h2>Music distribution and accessibility</h2>
            <p>Improvements to technology have majorly evolved the music industry. One of the main advances that skyrocketed the music industry
              was the digital improvements that allowed the users to share and download their music 
              on music sharing platforms for free. This  and other digital distribution platforms such as iTunes or streaming services like spotify
              did significantly decrease the revenue in the music industry however it made the music itself much more accessible so I would 
              say it had a overall beneficial effect.
              
              Musicians can also perform for fans with livestream to reach audiences across the world which increases engagement of fans
              with their favourite artists with they may not be able to go and see live but in this it keeps the industry booming.
              Although it hurt the big guns in the music industry having cheap streaming services, it levelled the playing field which
              I belive was a necessary step to evolve the industry

          <h2>Creation of music</h2>
          <h5>For the Artists</h5>
          <p>Tech allows musicians to record at a low cost and with ease for example at a home studio recording as this is now standardised. 
            Music streaming services can also help clean up songs i.e. balance the dynamics etc. for people with a lack of experience in this. 
          It can also reduce production time of songs as it can help the artists complete the tasks that aren’t based around the music itself 

          </p>
          <h5>Artificial Intelligence</h5>
          <p>
            Technology has also evolved to be able to generate music using extensive databases of existing music, learning musical strucutres, 
          harmonies, melodies, rhtythms, dynamics, timbres and forms to generate more music that matches the style of the material in the 
          database to a simple prompt entered by the user. This could mean that companies could end up cutting out human artists out 
          of the equation almost altogether meaning more money for the giant streaming services but this would be a less human 
          approach to making music.
          </p>
          <h2>Evolution of music</h2>
          <p>Any great new music style could be determined by a new way of using tech, so AI should be viewed
            positively in this as it could create so much. I.e. needs electronics to get the electric guitar which would’ve meant
              no rock n roll. The Beatles used technology to speed up and slow down the tapes of the different instruments in the tracks they
              had recorded to match their pitch and tempo which was revolutionary at the time. Overall technology has been involved heavily
              in the evolution of music and it is not stopping! AI is the newest of the technology to enter and change the music industry.
                Whilst we went into more details of this in early sections of the page machine learning has allowed us to create high volume 
                of trending music as well as new potential genres by mixing old genres with their vast databases which would definitely have
                a positive impact on music in general.
