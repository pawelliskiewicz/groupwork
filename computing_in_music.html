        <h2>Music distribution and accessibility</h2>
        <p>Improvements to technology have majorly evolved the music industry. One of the main advances that skyrocketed the music industry
           was the digital improvements that allowed the music industry to grow and where users can share and download their music 
           on music sharing platforms for free. This  and other digital distribution platforms ie iTunes or streaming services like spotify
           did significantly decrease the revenue in the music industry however it made the music itself much more accessible so  
          
          Musicians can also perform for fans with livestream to reach audiences across the world which increases engagement of fans
          with their favourite artists with they may not be able to go and see live but in this it keeps the industry booming.
          Although it hurt the big guns in the music industry having cheap streaming services, it levelled the playing field which
          I belive was a necessary step to evolve the industry

    <h2>Creation of music</h2>
    <h5>For the Artists</h5>
    <p>Tech allows musicians to record at a low cost and with ease for example at a home studio recording as this is now standardised. 
      Music streaming services can also help clean up songs i.e. balance the dynamics etc. for people with a lack of experience in this. 
    It can also reduce production time of songs as it can help the artists complete the tasks that aren’t based around the music itself 

    </p>
    <h5>Artificial Intelligence</h5>
    <p>
      Technology has also evolved to be able to generate music using extensive databases of existing music, learning musical strucutres, 
    harmonies, melodies, rhtythms, dynamics, timbres and forms to generate more music that matches the style of the material in the 
    database to a simple prompt entered by the user. This could mean that companies could end up cutting out human artists out 
    of the equation almost altogether meaning more money for the giant streaming services but this would be a less human 
    approach to making music.
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution of music</h2>
    <p>... beatles etc.


      Arguably any great new music style could be determined by a new way of using tech so AI should be viewed positively in this as it could create so much 
      Ie needs electronics to get the electric guitar which would’ve meant no rock n roll
